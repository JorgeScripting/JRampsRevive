Revive Script On PvP Ramps

This Script Was Made For Mostly 100kordie Servers But Can Be Used On Others Aswell Ive Been Looking For This Script A Long Time And Never Found It So I Decided To Code It Myself And This Is How It Turned Out.

When You Press E In The Purple Circle It Revives You And Gives You Armor And Launches Fireworks And If Ur Using A Taskbar U Can Enable Dat In The Cl_pvpres.lua Files With Removing The And The Script Also Uses Mythic Notify And If You Have Dat You Can Also Enable It Behind The Green Code By Removing The -- Behind The Green Code. And If Ur Using ProgressBars Replace exports["taskbar"]:taskBar(2500,"Reviving...") with exports['progressBars']:startUI(2500, "Reviving...")
